    <p>My name is Annaliese Garcia and I am in my senior year at the University of Miami. I will be graduating in May with a degree in Communications. I was born and raised in Miami, Florida where I was brought up in a Cuban household, with parents of Cuban decent. That makes me second generation Cuban-American.</p>
	  <p>In Miami, I live with my parents, my older sister and my younger brother who I spend a lot of my spare time with. I graduated from an all-girl high school, Our Lady of Lourdes Academy, where I was captain of the schoolâ€™s dance team. I was also part of a contemporary dance company outside of school. I began dancing at the age of 4; so, my life, as I knew it, consisted of living and breathing dance.</p>
	  <p>On my spare time in Miami, I like to immerse myself in anything active, such as boating and riding horses. Since I no longer dance, I took up yoga to continue a similar exercise routine. I hope to eventually become an entertainment lawyer.</p>
